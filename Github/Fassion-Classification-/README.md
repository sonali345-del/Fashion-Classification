🧥 Fashion Classification
This project implements a deep learning model to classify clothing images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Using TensorFlow and Keras, it builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish between 10 different fashion categories such as T-shirts, trousers, and sneakers.

🚀 Features
Loads and preprocesses the Fashion MNIST dataset

Visualizes sample images for better data understanding

Builds and trains a CNN with multiple layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dense)

Evaluates model performance on test data

Displays predictions and classification results visually

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

🛠️ Technologies
Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy, Matplotlib

📈 Results
The trained model achieves solid performance on the test set, effectively distinguishing between different clothing items.
